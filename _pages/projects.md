### 🧭 Peer-Mentor Advising Chatbot  
**FastAPI + TinyLlama | Local LLM | Feb 2025 – Present**  

I am developing a multi-turn chatbot that simulates faculty–student advising conversations using **FastAPI** and **TinyLlama**.  
This project tests a **Survey-Grounded + Template→Rewrite** framework against a plain LLM baseline.

**Key Highlights**
- Implements **template-guided neural generation** to insert academic data (GPA, workload, prerequisites) and rewrite for empathy and fluency.  
- Evaluates factuality, empathy, relevance, and naturalness using **LLM-as-judge** and human ratings.  
- Introduces adaptive student profiles (weak / average / strong) to study tone and response style.  
- Logs both structured templates and rewritten text for factual consistency.

**Goal:** To design a *trustworthy, empathetic* advising chatbot that personalizes academic support.

### 🧠 Hybrid Semantic–Graph Speech Analysis for Alzheimer’s Detection  
**Sentence-BERT + Graph Metrics | SEAWINDS Symposium 2025 (MSOE) | Oct 2025 – Present**   

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-View%20on%20GitHub-black)](https://github.com/Somamohanty5/Hybrid-Semantic-Graph-Speech-Analysis-for-Early-Detection-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease)

I am building a hybrid semantic–graph pipeline that analyzes speech coherence for early Alzheimer’s detection.

**Key Highlights**
- Extract semantic embeddings using **Sentence-BERT**.  
- Construct semantic graphs to represent lexical and contextual links.  
- Compute **graph metrics** (density, clustering, degree) to capture disorganization patterns.  
- Evaluate relationships between linguistic graph structure and cognitive decline.

**Goal:** To identify speech-based markers that can serve as explainable early indicators of Alzheimer’s disease.

Analyzed 20K Amazon shoe reviews using **VADER**, **RoBERTa**, and **LDA** to extract sentiment and brand trends.

**Key Highlights**
- Discovered customer sentiments on comfort, durability, and pricing.  
- Identified annual brand preference trends using topic modeling.  
- Recommended data-driven stocking strategies.
**Goal:** To optimize inventory decisions using data-driven sentiment and trend analysis.

### 🎥 Making Instructional Videos Smarter and Easier to Follow  
**Whisper + Sentence-BERT + spaCy + AllenNLP | NLP & Semantic AI Pipeline  | Feb 2025 – May 2025**  

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-View%20on%20GitHub-black)](https://github.com/Somamohanty5/Making-Instructional-Videos-Smarter-and-Easier-to-Follow)

Built an **AI-powered pipeline** that aligns YouTube instructional video narration with step-by-step textual instructions using NLP and semantic similarity.

**Key Highlights**
- Transcribed audio with **Whisper ASR**.  
- Extracted instructional sentences using POS tagging and heuristics.  
- Performed dual matching: **NLP-based (word overlap)** vs **AI-based (semantic similarity)**.  
- Extracted **Action**, **Tool**, and **Purpose** via spaCy + AllenNLP SRL.  
- Visualized results using F1 score bar charts, word clouds, and similarity boxplots.

**Impact:** Demonstrated that semantic AI matching significantly outperformed lexical overlap for aligning instructional content.

### 🧬 Breast Cancer Subtype Prediction  
**SMOTE + Random Forest + LSTM | Bioinformatics & ML  | Oct 2024 – Dec 2024**  

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-View%20on%20GitHub-black)](https://github.com/Somamohanty5/Predicting-breast-cancer-subtypes-using-machine-learning-and-dna-mutation-data)

Applied classical ML and deep learning models to DNA mutation data to classify breast cancer subtypes.

**Key Highlights**
- Balanced data using **SMOTE** and **Isolation Forest**.  
- Compared **Random Forest**, **SVM**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM** models.  
- Evaluated using ROC-AUC and F1 metrics to identify strong predictors.

**Goal:** To enhance early diagnosis of breast cancer using interpretable bioinformatics models.
