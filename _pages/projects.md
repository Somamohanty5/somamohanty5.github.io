### 🧭 Peer-Mentor Advising Chatbot  
**FastAPI + TinyLlama | Local LLM | Feb 2025 – Present**  

Developed a multi-turn chatbot simulating faculty–student advising conversations using **FastAPI** and **TinyLlama**.  
The project tests a **Survey-Grounded + Template→Rewrite** generation framework versus a plain LLM baseline.  

**Key Highlights**
- Designed **template-guided neural generation**: insert stored values (GPA, workload, prerequisites), then rewrite for empathy & clarity.  
- Implemented local **LLM-as-judge** evaluation (factuality, empathy, relevance, naturalness).  
- Introduced adaptive student profiles (weak / average / strong) to test tone alignment.  
- Logs structured JSON templates and final responses for factual audits.

**Goal:** Build a *trustworthy and empathetic* advising chatbot capable of accurate, human-like academic guidance.

### 🧠 Hybrid Semantic–Graph Speech Analysis for Alzheimer’s Detection  
**Sentence-BERT + Graph Metrics | Presented at SEAWINDS Symposium 2025 (MSOE)**  
[🔗 View Repository](https://github.com/Somamohanty5/Alzheimer-Speech-Graph-Analysis)

Developed a hybrid semantic–graph pipeline to detect early cognitive decline using speech data.  

**Core Components**
- Extracted semantic graphs from spontaneous speech (Pitt Corpus).  
- Computed **graph metrics** (density, degree centrality, clustering).  
- Modeled semantic coherence using **Sentence-BERT embeddings**.  
- Compared graph-based and semantic features to identify early Alzheimer’s indicators.  

**Outcome:** Demonstrated explainable linguistic disorganization patterns that can act as early biomarkers for Alzheimer’s.

### 🥿 Optimizing Inventory for Footwear Retailers  
**NLP + Sentiment Analysis | Python, Pandas, VADER, RoBERTa, LDA**  
[🔗 View Repository](https://github.com/Somamohanty5/OPTIMIZING-INVENTORY-AND-SALES-STRATEGY-FOR-A-FOOTWEAR-RETAILER-USING-SENTIMENT-AND-TREND-ANALYSIS-)

Analyzed 20K Amazon shoe reviews using **VADER**, **RoBERTa**, and **LDA** to extract sentiment and brand trends.  

**Highlights**
- Uncovered customer perceptions on comfort, durability, and style.  
- Identified seasonal and brand-level preference shifts.  
- Suggested data-driven stocking strategies projected to reduce inventory waste by up to **15%**.

**Goal:** Use sentiment analytics to guide inventory optimization and improve retail forecasting.

### 🎥 Making Instructional Videos Smarter and Easier to Follow  
**Whisper + Sentence-BERT + spaCy + AllenNLP | NLP & Semantic AI Pipeline**  
[🔗 View Repository](https://github.com/Somamohanty5/Making-Instructional-Videos-Smarter-and-Easier-to-Follow)

Built an **AI-powered system** that aligns narration from YouTube instructional videos with step-by-step textual instructions using NLP and semantic matching.  

**Key Features**
- Audio transcription with **Whisper ASR**.  
- Instruction extraction via **POS tagging** and heuristics.  
- Dual matching approach: word-overlap (NLP) vs semantic similarity (Sentence-BERT).  
- Extracted **Action**, **Tool**, and **Purpose** with spaCy + AllenNLP SRL.  
- Visualized F1 scores, cosine similarity, and mismatch word clouds.

**Impact:** Demonstrated that semantic AI matching significantly outperforms lexical overlap for aligning instructional content.

### 🧬 Breast Cancer Subtype Prediction  
**SMOTE + Random Forest + LSTM | Bioinformatics & ML**  
[🔗 View Repository](https://github.com/Somamohanty5/Breast-Cancer-Subtype-Prediction)

Applied classical ML and deep learning models on DNA mutation datasets to classify breast cancer subtypes.  

**Pipeline**
- Handled imbalanced data using **SMOTE** and **Isolation Forest**.  
- Compared **Random Forest**, **SVM**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM** performance.  
- Evaluated using ROC-AUC and F1 metrics to identify robust predictors.  

**Goal:** Improve early subtype identification and understand mutation-level differences in cancer progression.
