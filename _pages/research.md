My research focuses on building **trustworthy, empathetic, and explainable AI systems** at the intersection of **Conversational AI**, **HealthTech ML**, and **Human–AI Interaction**.

### 🧭 1. Peer-Mentor Advising Chatbot (Thesis Project)
**Title:** *Survey-Grounded Style + Template→Rewrite vs Plain LLM*  
**Advisor:** Prof. Susan McRoy (University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee)  
**Duration:** Feb 2025 – Present  

I am developing a peer-mentor ↔ student advising chatbot that compares two advisor strategies:  
1. **Raw LLM dialogs**, and  
2. **Template→Rewrite generation**, where stored academic values (GPA, prerequisites, workload) are inserted via templates and rewritten for fluency and empathy.

I evaluate four conditions — *Survey only*, *Survey + Ethics*, *Survey + Templates*, and *Survey + Ethics + Templates* — across weak, average, and strong student profiles.

**Research Focus**
- Modeling tone, ethics, and factual accuracy in advising dialogs  
- Evaluating empathy and relevance in LLM-based academic guidance  
- Template-guided neural generation for trustworthy educational AI  

**Methods**
- Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (local via Ollama/LM Studio)  
- Template→Rewrite pipeline with structured JSON logging for factual audits  
- LLM-as-judge scoring (factuality, empathy, relevance, naturalness)  
- Human pilot evaluation with peer mentors and academic advisors  

**Goal:** To develop reproducible frameworks for *empathetic and accurate conversational agents* in educational settings.

### 🧠 2. Hybrid Semantic–Graph Speech Analysis for Alzheimer’s Detection  
**Title:** *Correlating Semantic Graph Patterns with Cognitive Decline Markers*  
**Advisor:** Prof. Lu He (University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee)  
**Duration:** Oct 2025 – Present  
**Accepted at:** SEAWINDS Symposium 2025 (MSOE)  

I am investigating early detection of Alzheimer’s disease through **speech graph analytics** and **semantic embeddings**.  
This research models spontaneous speech as semantic graphs and correlates their structural patterns with cognitive decline indicators.

**Research Components**
- Process DementiaBank Pitt Corpus transcripts using Sentence-BERT  
- Construct semantic graphs with NetworkX to analyze lexical connectivity  
- Extract metrics such as graph density, node degree, and coherence  
- Identify relationships between semantic disorganization and cognitive decline  

**Goal:** To advance explainable speech biomarkers for early Alzheimer’s detection and cognitive health monitoring.
